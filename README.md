### 3. Setup Firebase
#### Create Firebase Project: Go to Firebase Console, create a project, and set up Firestore and Authentication.

#### Enable Authentication:
In Firebase Console, navigate to Authentication > Sign-in method.
Enable Email/Password and Google sign-in methods.

#### Firestore Setup: Create a collection called users in Firestore where user data and cart will be stored.

### 4. Configure Firebase in Your Project
Create a `.env.local` file at the root of your project and add your Firebase config variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
```
Replace the placeholders with your actual Firebase configuration details. You can find these in the Firebase Console under Project settings > General > Your apps.

### Run the Project
To start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will run the project on http://localhost:3000.

## Application Flow
